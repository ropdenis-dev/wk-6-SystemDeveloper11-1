## Early Automated Test Scripts (React Testing Library)

```javascript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "../App";

test("shows error when submitting empty form", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);
  fireEvent.click(submitButton);
  expect(screen.getByText(/please fill all fields/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("submits form correctly with valid input", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const nameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/name/i);
  const locationInput = screen.getByLabelText(/location/i);
  const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);

  fireEvent.change(nameInput, { target: { value: "John Doe" } });
  fireEvent.change(locationInput, { target: { value: "Nairobi" } });
  fireEvent.click(submitButton);

  expect(screen.getByText(/request submitted successfully/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
### Manual Testing Workflow
- Open the application on Chrome or mobile emulator.
- Navigate through all pages: Home, Dashboard, Feedback, Awareness, Admin Panel.
- Perform the following:
  - Submit forms with empty and valid data.
  - Apply filters and sort tables on Dashboard.
  - Update request status in Admin Panel.
  - Submit feedback with valid Request IDs.
  - Test long input text to observe layout behavior.
  - Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes.
  - Inspect accessibility using DevTools and screen readers.

### Automated Test Scripts (React Testing Library)

```javascript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "../App";

// Test 1: Submit empty form should show validation errors
test("shows error when submitting empty form", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);
  fireEvent.click(submitButton);
  expect(screen.getByText(/please fill all fields/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Test 2: Submit form with valid inputs
test("submits form correctly with valid input", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const nameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/name/i);
  const locationInput = screen.getByLabelText(/location/i);
  const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);

  fireEvent.change(nameInput, { target: { value: "John Doe" } });
  fireEvent.change(locationInput, { target: { value: "Nairobi" } });
  fireEvent.click(submitButton);

  expect(screen.getByText(/request submitted successfully/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
